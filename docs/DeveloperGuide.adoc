== Introduction

Welcome to *_ePiggy_*! *ePiggy* is a desktop application designed to inculcate good spending habits in students
through allowing them to track their finances. It includes everything from tracking expenses, managing budgets
to setting goals. +

This developer guide is a self-contained resource designed to align potential developers to a common vision. It guides
developers of all levels, allowing them to learn more about the workings behind the scenes and how to make use of them effectively.

If you want to learn how you can make *_ePiggy_* even better, start here! +

== Setting up

image::developerguidesettingup.png[width="350"]

=== Prerequisites

. *JDK `9`* or later
+
[WARNING]
JDK `10` on Windows will fail to run tests in <<UsingGradle#Running-Tests, headless mode>> due to a https://github.com/javafxports/openjdk-jfx/issues/66[JavaFX bug].
Windows developers are highly recommended to use JDK `9`.

. *IntelliJ* IDE
+
[NOTE]
IntelliJ by default has Gradle and JavaFx plugins installed. +
Do not disable them. If you have disabled them, go to `File` > `Settings` > `Plugins` to re-enable them.


=== Setting up the project in your computer

. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer
. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project dialog first)
. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle
.. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`
.. Click `New...` and find the directory of the JDK
. Click `Import Project`
. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click `OK`
. Click `Open as Project`
. Click `OK` to accept the default settings
. Open a console and run the command `gradlew processResources` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew processResources`). It should finish with the `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` message. +
This will generate all resources required by the application and tests.
. Open link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow.java`] and check for any code errors
.. Due to an ongoing https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IDEA-189060[issue] with some of the newer versions of IntelliJ, code errors may be detected even if the project can be built and run successfully
.. To resolve this, place your cursor over any of the code section highlighted in red. Press kbd:[ALT + ENTER], and select `Add '--add-modules=...' to module compiler options` for each error
. Repeat this for the test folder as well (e.g. check link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/ui/HelpWindowTest.java[`HelpWindowTest.java`] for code errors, and if so, resolve it the same way)

=== Verifying the setup

. Run the `seedu.address.MainApp` and try a few commands
. <<Testing,Run the tests>> to ensure they all pass.

=== Configurations to do before writing code

==== Configuring the coding style

This project follows https://github.com/oss-generic/process/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.adoc[oss-generic coding standards]. IntelliJ's default style is mostly compliant with ours but it uses a different import order from ours. To rectify,

. Go to `File` > `Settings...` (Windows/Linux), or `IntelliJ IDEA` > `Preferences...` (macOS)
. Select `Editor` > `Code Style` > `Java`
. Click on the `Imports` tab to set the order

* For `Class count to use import with '\*'` and `Names count to use static import with '*'`: Set to `999` to prevent IntelliJ from contracting the import statements
* For `Import Layout`: The order is `import static all other imports`, `import java.\*`, `import javax.*`, `import org.\*`, `import com.*`, `import all other imports`. Add a `<blank line>` between each `import`

Optionally, you can follow the <<UsingCheckstyle#, UsingCheckstyle.adoc>> document to configure Intellij to check style-compliance as you write code.

==== Updating documentation to match your fork

After forking the repo, the documentation will still have the SE-EDU branding and refer to the `se-edu/addressbook-level4` repo.

If you plan to develop this fork as a separate product (i.e. instead of contributing to `se-edu/addressbook-level4`), you should do the following:

. Configure the <<Docs-SiteWideDocSettings, site-wide documentation settings>> in link:{repoURL}/build.gradle[`build.gradle`], such as the `site-name`, to suit your own project.

. Replace the URL in the attribute `repoURL` in link:{repoURL}/docs/DeveloperGuide.adoc[`DeveloperGuide.adoc`] and link:{repoURL}/docs/UserGuide.adoc[`UserGuide.adoc`] with the URL of your fork.

=== Setting up CI

Set up Travis to perform Continuous Integration (CI) for your fork. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to set it up.

After setting up Travis, you can optionally set up coverage reporting for your team fork (see <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Coverage reporting could be useful for a team repository that hosts the final version but it is not that useful for your personal fork.

Optionally, you can set up AppVeyor as a second CI (see <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Having both Travis and AppVeyor ensures your App works on both Unix-based platforms and Windows-based platforms (Travis is Unix-based and AppVeyor is Windows-based)

==== Getting started with coding

When you are ready to start coding,

1. Get some sense of the overall design by reading <<Design-Architecture>>.
2. Take a look at <<GetStartedProgramming>>.

== Design

image::developerguidedesign.png[width="350"]

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::Architecture.png[width="600"]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.pptx` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder. To update a diagram, modify the diagram in the pptx file, select the objects of the diagram, and choose `Save as picture`.

`Main` has only one class called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:

* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

.Class Diagram of the Logic Component

[discrete]
==== How the architecture components interact with each other

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `deleteExpense 1`.

.Component interactions for `deleteExpense 1` command
image::SDforDeleteExpense.png[width="800"]

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, `BrowserPanel` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `EPiggyParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a expense).
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
.  In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("de 1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `de 1` Command
image::DeleteExpenseSdForLogic.png[width="800"]

// tag::model[]
[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the ePiggy data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Expense>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Budget>` that can be 'observed'
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableValue<Goal>` that can be 'observed'
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

[NOTE]
As a more OOP model, we store an `Item` list in `ePiggy`, which `Expense` can reference to.
This allows `ePiggy` to only require one `Item` object per unique `Item`,
instead of each `Expense` needing their own `Item` object. An example of how such a model may look like is given below. +
 +
image:ModelClassBetterOopDiagram.png[width="800"]

// end::model[]

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the ePiggy data in json format and read it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

== Implementation

image::developerguideimplementation.png[width="350"]

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented. It is split into 6 sections:
_basic_, _find and sort_, _budget_, _goal_, _report_ and _miscellaneous_.

=== Basic Features
// tag::ae[]
==== Add expense feature
*_ePiggy_* allows users to add an expense record to the system.
To use this feature, users need to enter the `addExpense` command,
with fields `name` and `amount`, and optional fields `date` and `tag`.
If `date` is not specified, the current date will be used.

* `addExpense n/Chicken rice set $/5 t/Food d/21/02/2019` +
The command above adds an expense record for a $5 chicken rice set, tagged as Food with the date as 21/02/2019. +

===== Current Implementation
The figure below shows the sequence diagram for the `addExpense` command:

.Add Expense Sequence Diagram
image::AddExpenseSequenceDiagram.png[widith="800]

The command is recognized by `parseCommand` and an `AddExpenseCommandParser` is created,
which is used to parse the command with the separated input arguments.
An `Expense` is created from the arguments, which is used to create an `AddExpenseCommand`. +
`AddExpenseCommand` is then executed by `Logic` and it calls `addExpense` of the model, which
add the `Expense` into the `ExpenseList`.
// end::ae[]

// tag::ee[]
==== Edit expense feature
*_ePiggy_* allows users to edit an existing expense record in the expense list.
To use this feature, users need to enter the `editExpense` command,
with the `INDEX` (in the displaying list) of the expense to be edited, along with
the fields that are to be modified.

* `editExpense 1 n/Pen $1 t/Supplies` +
The command above edits the name, cost and tag of the
first expense in the displaying list to ‘Pen’, ‘$1’ and ‘Supplies’ respectively. +

The command is recognized by `parseCommand` and an `EditExpenseCommandParser` is created,
Then it create an `EditExpenseCommand` object with the `EditExpenseDescriptor` specifying the fields to be edited. +
The command object is then executed by `Logic` and it calls `setExpense` of the model, which
replaces the old `Expense` by the edited one.
// end::ee[]

// tag::de[]
==== Delete expense feature
*_ePiggy_* allows users to remove an expense record from the expense list.
To use this feature, users need to enter the `deleteExpense` command,
with the `INDEX` (in the displaying list) of the expense to be deleted.

* `deleteExpense 1` +
The command above deletes the first expense in the displaying expense list. +

The command is recognized by `parseCommand` and an `DeleteExpenseCommandParser` is created,
Then it create an`DeleteExpenseCommand` object with the parsed index. +
The command object is then executed by `Logic` and it calls `deleteExpense` of the model, which
removes the `Expense` from the `ExpenseList`.
// end::de[]


// tag::aa[]
==== Add allowance feature
*_ePiggy_* allows the tracking of allowances by adding
allowances into the expenses list. This helps in calculating the net amount of money the user has. +
Similar to expenses, the user will have to specify the `name` and the  `amount`,
with optional fields for  `date`, and `tag`.

* `addAllowance n/From Dad $/30 d/04/02/2019 t/School` +
The command above adds a new allowance entry of `$30` with the title `From Dad`, on `4th February 2019`
with the `School` tag. +

[NOTE]
`Allowance` and `Expense` are shown in the same list because we made `Allowance` a subclass of
`Expense`. We consider an `Allowance` to be a type of negative expense which makes calculating
the total savings in *ePiggy* easier.

===== Current Implementation
The figure below shows the sequence diagram for the `addAllowance` command:

.Add Allowance Sequence Diagram
image::AddAllowanceSequenceDiagram.png[widith="800]

The command is recognised by `parseCommand` and an `AddAllowanceCommandParser` is created,
which is used to separate the arguments into their respective fields.
A new `Item` is created and this `Item` is used in creating the
`Allowance` object, which is used to create an `AddAllowanceCommand`. +
`AddAllowanceCommand` is then executed by `Logic` and `addAllowance()` is called from the model,
which adds the `Allowance` into the `ExpenseList`.

===== Design Considerations
*Aspect: Should `Allowance` be a subclass of `Expense`?*

* *Alternative 1 (current choice):* `Allowance` should be a subclass of `Expense`.
** Pros: `Allowance` and `Expense` are very similar, the only difference being whether to
add or subtract when calculating total savings. Extending `Expense` would reduce a lot of
repeated code. This way we can place allowances and expenses in the same list.
** Cons: This `Allowance` IS-A `Expense` relationship does not necessarily hold in real life.

* *Alternative 2:* `Allowance` and `Expense` should both be subclasses of the same parent class
** Pros: Makes more logical sense.
** Cons: Requires more code in determining which object is which.
// end::aa[]

// tag::ea[]
==== Edit allowance feature
*_ePiggy_* allows users to edit previously entered allowances.
It requires the `INDEX` of the allowance, as well as the fields to be modified.

* `editAllowance 1 $/50 d/06/03/2019`

_The command above edits the allowance with index `1` on the allowance and expense list,
to change the amount to `$50` and the date to `06/03/2019`._

[NOTE]
While allowances and expenses are shown on the same list, the `INDEX` specified must belong
to an `Allowance`, otherwise the command would not work.

===== Current Implementation
The command is recognised by `parseCommand` and an `EditAllowanceCommandParser`
is created. It then creates an `EditAllowanceCommand` object with an
`EditAllowanceDescriptor` specifying the fields to be edited.
`EditAllowanceCommand` is the executed by `Logic` and calls `setExpense()`
of the model, which replaces the old `Allowance` with the updated one. +
Since only allowances can be edited with the `editAllowance` command, the `EditAllowanceCommand`
will first check if the `INDEX` specified points to an `Allowance`. If `INDEX` points to an
`Expense`, a `CommandException` will be thrown.

===== Design Considerations
*Aspect: Should the edit command for `Allowance` and `Expense` be combined?*

* *Alternative 1 (current version):* Edits for `Allowance` and `Expense` should have their own
dedicated commands.
** Pros: It is easier for the user to understand the function of the command.
** Cons: More commands means more coding required. The long list of allowance and expense
specific commands also means a longer list of commands.

* *Alternative 2:* Combine `editAllowance` and `editExpense` commands into 1 `edit` command.
** Pros: Easier to implement, lesser commands for the user to remember.
** Cons: Using `edit` might be too vague, as it does not specify what it is editing (could be
mistaken with editing budget or goal).

// end::ea[]
// tag::da[]
==== Delete allowance feature
*_ePiggy_* allows users to delete an allowance from the list using the
`deleteAllowance` command by specifying the `INDEX` of the allowance to be deleted.

* `deleteAllowance 2` +
The command above deletes the allowance with index `2` on the allowance and expense list. +

===== Current Implementation
The figure below shows the sequence diagram for the `deleteAllowance` command:

.Delete Allowance Sequence Diagram
image::DeleteAllowanceSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

The command is recognised by `parseCommand` and an `DeleteAllowanceCommandParser`
is created. Then, it creates a `DeleteAllowanceCommand` object with the given
`INDEX`. `DeleteAllowanceCommand` is then executed by `Logic` and it calls
`deleteAllowance()` of the model, which removes the `Allowance` from the
`ExpenseList`.
// end::da[]

//tag::reverse[]
==== Reverse list feature
*_ePiggy_* allows the user to list the expenses in any order they want by using the 'list' feature and this `reverseList` feature.
This makes viewing of expenses more customisable and convenient for the user.

* `reverseList` +
The command above lists the expenses in reverse. +

===== Current Implementation
Given below is a UML sequence diagram of how the `reverseList` command works along with a step-by-step
explanation. +

.Reverse List Sequence Diagram
image::rLuml.png[witdh="750"]

Step 1: User enters `rl`.  The command is received by `EPiggyParser` which then creates `ReverseListCommand` object
and returned to `LogicManager`. +

Step 2: `LogicManager` calls `ReverseListCommand#execute()`,which then calls `Model#reverseFilteredExpensesList()`
method to set the comparator for sorting. +

Step 3: `Model#reverseFilteredExpensesList()` then calls `EPiggy#reverseExpenseList()` method. `EPiggy#reverseExpenseList`
then calls `ExpenseList#reverse`. `ExpenseList#reverse` then calls the static `FXCollections#reverse`
method to reverse the `internalList`.  +

Step 4: Expense List panel is updated by expenses listed in reverse order. A `CommandResult` is then created and
returned to `LogicManager`.

//end::reverse[]

=== Find and Sort Features
//tag::findexpense[]
==== Find feature
*_ePiggy_* allows the user to filter specific expenses by entering single or multiple keywords. Expenses that satisfy
all the keywords are displayed in the expense list panel. Furthermore, it searches for words similar to the user's
input, considering that the user might have made a typing error, by applying the concept of _Levenshtein distance_ fixed by a
upper bound.

* `find n/Nasi Lemak $/4.00 d/01/04/2019 t/lunch`

The above command finds expense(s) with the `Name` Nasi Lemak, `Cost` of $4.00, purchased on
`Date` 1st April, 2019 and tagged with `Tag` lunch.

[NOTE]
`Date` format is `dd/MM/yyyy`. +
Empty input keywords are not allowed and a appropriate error will be shown.

[TIP]
All keywords in this command are optional, provided that there is at least one input keyword. For
example, suppose we want to filter out all `Expense` s with `Cost` between $1 and $10.5 (both inclusive),
then the command should be just `find $/1:10.5`.
Similarly for other type of keywords.

===== Current Implementation
Given below is a UML sequence diagram of how the `find` command works along with a step-by-step
explanation.

.Find Sequence Diagram
image::fEuml.png[witdh="750"]

Step 1: User enters `find n/Nasi Lemak`. The command is
received by `EPiggyParser` which then creates `FindCommandParser` object and and calls
`FindCommandParser#parse()` method. +

Step 2: `FindCommandParser#parse()` first checks if input is invalid and throws a
`ParseException` otherwise it calls `ArgumentTokenizer#tokenize()` to tokenize the `String` input
 into keywords and store them in an `ArgumentMultimap` Object. +

Step 3: `FindCommandParser#parse()` method then creates an `ExpenseContainsKeywordsPredicate`
Object. It implements `Predicate<Expense>` interface. It performs the filtering of expenses. +

Step 4: A `FindCommand` object is created with `ExpenseContainsKeywordsPredicate` as parameter and
returned to `LogicManager`. +

Step 5: `LogicManager` calls `FindCommand#execute()`,which then calls `Model#updateFilteredExpenseList()`
method to update the predicate of `FilteredList<Expense>`. `FilteredList` now contains only a set of
expenses which was filtered by the new predicate. +

Step 6: Expense List panel is updated by filtered set of expenses. A `CommandResult` is then created and
returned to `LogicManager`.

===== Design considerations
This feature can be implemented in different ways depending on how the target expenses are found.

*Aspect: How should the expenses be filtered?*

* *Alternative 1:* Storing expenses as and when they are added into separate files. +
** Pros: More efficient as there is no need to check for ALL expenses. +
** Cons: Need to change the original architecture of storage. +
* *Alternative 2 (current choice):* Search through all the expenses and find the ones with matching keywords. +
** Pros: : Easy to implement as there is no need to change original architecture. +
** Cons: Will take more time as it will search through large number of expenses. +

//end::findexpense[]

//tag::sortexpense[]
==== Sort feature
*_ePiggy_* allows the user to sort expenses (and allowances) by entering the keyword (name, cost or date) to determine
the sorting sequence. By default, a new expense/allowance entry is placed at the bottom of the list (`ExpensePanel`). This
sorting mechanism allows the user to sort the expenses/allowances accordingly.

* `sort n/` +
The above command sorts expense(s) according to their `Name` in a lexicographical order. +

[NOTE]
Empty user input is not allowed and a appropriate error will be shown. Similarly, multiple keywords (`Prefix`) are also not allowed.

===== Current Implementation
Given below is a UML sequence diagram of how the `sort` command works along with a step-by-step
explanation. +

.Sort Sequence Diagram
image::sEuml.png[witdh="750"]

Step 1: User enters `sort $/`.  The command is received by `EPiggyParser` which then creates `SortCommandParser` object
and calls `SortCommandParser#parse()` method. +

Step 2: `SortCommandParser#parse()` first checks if input is invalid and throws a
        `ParseException` otherwise it calls `ArgumentTokenizer#tokenize()` to tokenize the `String` input
         into keywords and store them in an `ArgumentMultimap` Object. +

Step 3: `SortCommandParser#arePrefixesPresent` method is then used to determine the input `Prefix`, and depending on the `Prefix`,
appropriate Comparator object is created. In this case, `Prefix` is `$/`, so a new `CompareExpensesByCost` object is created.
It implements the `java.util.Comparator` interface. +

Step 4: A `SortCommand` object is created with `CompareExpensesByCost` object as a parameter and
returned to `LogicManager`. +

Step 5: `LogicManager` calls `SortCommand#execute()`,which then calls `Model#sortExpenses()`
method to set the comparator for sorting. +

Step 6: `Model#sortExpenses()` then calls `EPiggy#sortExpense` method with Comparator object as parameter. `EPiggy#sortExpense`
then calls `ExpenseList#sort` to set the comparator of `internalList`. `ExpenseList#sort` then calls the static `FXCollections#sort`
method to sort the `internalList`.  +

Step 7: `SortCommand#execute()`,which then calls `Model#updateFilteredExpenseList()`
        method to update the predicate of `FilteredList<Expense>`. `FilteredList` now contains all
        expenses in sorted order. +

Step 6: Expense List panel is updated by sorted expenses. A `CommandResult` is then created and
returned to `LogicManager`.

=== Budget Features
//end::sortexpense[]
==== Add budget feature

// tag::addbudget[]

*_ePiggy_* allows users to add new budgets to monitor their expenses within a user specified period of time. This command
requires users to specify the `amount`, `start date` and `time period (in days)` of the budget in the command. +

* `addBudget $/500 p/31 d/01/03/2019` +
The command above adds a budget with `$500` which starts on `1st March 2019` and lasts for `31` days. +

The budget will compute the end date and provide a status based on the local date.
The status will include whether the budget is an old, current or future budget, as well as the `remaining amount` until the budget is exceeded and `remaining days` till the end of the budget.
This is so that users are aware about how much they have spent. +

Adding of overlapping budgets are not allowed in ePiggy.
[NOTE]
A `budget` is considered overlapping if *any* of the dates *in between (inclusive)* one `budget`’s start *and* end dates is the *same* as the dates *in between (inclusive)* another `budget`’s start *and* end dates.

===== Current Implementation
Given below is a sequence diagram of how the `addBudget` command works: +

.Add Budget Sequence Diagram
image::addBudgetSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

The command is first recognised by `parseCommand` and an `AddBudgetCommandParser` is created, which is used to separate the
arguments into their respective fields. A new `Budget` is created, and is used to create an `AddBudgetCommand`. +
As long as the `Budget` object created does not overlap with any existing `Budget` objects, the `Budget` will be added
with `Model#addBudget()` and saved into the ePiggy storage. +

*Example usage scenario:* +
1. User launches application and enters `addBudget $/500 p/31 d/01/03/2019`. +
2. `AddBudgetCommandParser` takes in the arguments and parses the command to create the appropriate `Budget`. +
3. The `AddBudgetCommand` is passed back to the `LogicManager`, and the method `execute()` is called. The `Budget` is then added to the model.

===== Design Considerations
*Aspect: What user input should `addBudget` require?* +

* *Alternative 1 (current choice)*: the `addBudget` command requires the `amount`, `start date` and `time period (in days)` of the budget.
** Pros: Easy to make recurring daily, weekly or annual budgets.
** Cons: If users have the start date and end date in mind, they will have to manually calculate the period between the dates and input that instead of the end date.

* *Alternative 2* : the `addBudget` command requires the `amount`, `start date` and `end date` of the budget.
** Pros: Easy to make recurring monthly budgets.
** Cons: Could cause users to miss out on certain dates if they want budgets that are recurring (eg. sets a budget from 1st March to 30th March and 1st April to 30th April – 31st March is missed out).
// end::addbudget[]

==== Edit budget feature

// tag::editbudget[]
*_ePiggy_* allows the user to edit the `current budget`, with any of the specified parameters in `addBudget` (above). +

* `editBudget $/300`
* `editBudget $/400 p/7` +
The above commands edit the current budget to $300 and $400 with a period of 7 days respectively.

Similar to the `addBudget` command, budgets’ dates should not overlap each other.  Hence, the budget cannot be edited
such that the edited budget overlaps with another budget. +

[NOTE]
A `budget` is considered overlapping if *any* of the dates *in between (inclusive)* one `budget`’s start *and* end dates is the
*same* as the dates *in between (inclusive)* another `budget`’s start *and* end dates.

[TIP]
If the current budget is edited such that it is no longer a current budget, it can no longer be edited. Hence, users
should delete that budget and add a new budget using the `addBudget` command should they wish to edit that budget.

===== Current Implementation
The command’s current implementation uses parts of the legacy implementation to update the budget. The arguments are first parsed into
`EditBudgetCommandParser`, which separates the arguments into their respective fields. +
An `EditBudgetDescriptor` object is then created to temporarily hold this new information. +

[NOTE]
The prefixes applicable to `editBudget` are `$/`, `p/` and `d/`. At least one of them must
follow the `editBudget` command word.

Afterwards, a `budget` object is created from the `EditBudgetDescriptor` object. Then, the `budget` object is passed into ePiggy
through `Model.#setCurrentBudget()`, which will replace the current `budget` with the new `budget` passed in. +
Since only the current `budget` can be edited, the `editBudget` command will first check if a current `budget` is present in `ePiggy`’s
`budgetList` through `Model#getCurrentBudgetIndex()`. If the current `budget` does not exist, the command will feedback to the user that the
command entered is invalid. +

===== Design Considerations
*Aspect: Should we use a boolean `hasCurrentBudget` method or use the `index` of the current `budget` to verify if a
current `budget` exists?* +

* *Alternative 1* (current choice):
The `index` of the current `budget` is returned to the `editBudgetCommand`. If the returned integer is `-1`, it means that there is no current `budget`
present. The index is then used to retrieve the current budget.

** Pros: No additional method implementations required. The methods `Model#getFilteredBudgetList().get()` are sufficient to get the current budget.

** Cons: Calculations are done in the `editBudget` command’s `execute` method.

* *Alternative 2*: +
Using a boolean `hasCurrentBudget` method to check if a current `budget` exists in `budgetList`, then another `getCurrentBudget` method to get the current `budget`.

** Pros: Code will be written in `ePiggy` rather than at `editBudget` command and can be easily used for other commands.

** Cons: Will need to implement additional methods. Reduces the abstraction has the current `budget` is exposed to the entire project as it is a public method.

After much consideration, we decided to choose option 1 as other commands should not need to access the current `budget` specifically. It will be better
to have a greater level of abstraction. +
// end::editbudget[]

==== Delete budget feature

// tag::deletebudget[]

*_ePiggy_* allows the user to delete any budget, using the displayed `index` of the specific budget.

* `deleteBudget 2` +
The above command deletes the `Budget` with the displayed `index` of *2*.

The `Budget` to be deleted is identified by its displayed `index` and subsequently deleted. +

===== Current Implementation
Given below is a sequence diagram of how the `deleteBudget` command works: +

.Delete Budget Sequence Diagram
image::DeleteBudgetSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

The command’s current implementation retrieves the `budgetList` from `ePiggy` and removes the
budget at the zero-based version of the displayed `index`. +
A `listener` has been added to `budgetList`, so the order in which the budgets are displayed is the same
as the order of the budgets in `budgetList`. Furthermore, the indexes are unique. +
Hence, if the `index` input by the user is negative or greater than the size of `budgetList`, this would indicate that the budget specified does not exist. The user will receive a feedback that the `index` specified is invalid.
// end::deletebudget[]

=== Goal Feature

// tag::setGoal[]
==== Set goal feature
*_ePiggy_* allows users to set a savings goal that they would like to save up to. +
It requires the user to specify the name of the goal, as well as the amount they would like to hit.

* `setGoal n/Nintendo Switch $/499`

The command above sets a goal with the name `Nintendo Switch` and with the amount `$499`

===== Current Implementation
Given below is a sequence diagram of how the `setGoal` command works:

.Set Goal Sequence Diagram
image::setGoalSequenceDiagram.PNG[width="800"]

The command is first parsed into `SetGoalCommandParser`, which separates the arguments into their respective fields. A new `Goal` is created and parsed into `SetGoalCommand`.
`Goal` will then be set with `Model#setGoal()` and saved into the ePiggy `Storage`.

*Example usage scenario:* +
1.	User launches application and enters `setGoal n/Nintendo Switch $/499`. +
2.	`SetGoalCommandParser` takes in the arguments and parses the command to create the appropriate `Goal`. +
3.	The `SetGoalCommand` is passed back to the `LogicManager`, and the method `execute()` is called. `Goal` is then set to the `model`.

===== Design considerations
*Aspect: `setGoal` (1 goal) VS `addGoal` (multiple goals)*

* *Alternative 1 (current choice):* `setGoal` (1 goal) +
** Pros: Easier to implement. Makes ePiggy easier to use. +
** Cons: Limits the user experience by allowing only 1 savings goal. +
* *Alternative 2:* `addGoal` (multiple goals) +
** Pros: Gives user freedom to set more than 1 goal. +
** Cons: Makes ePiggy more complicated, not suitable for younger age groups. +

// end::setGoal[]

// tag::report[]
=== Report Feature

==== Expense report feature
*_ePiggy_* allows users to view the report within a user-input period of time. +
This command requires users to specify the `date`, `month` or `year` of the report in the command.
Given below is a sequence diagram of how the `report` command works: +

.Report Sequence Diagram
image::reportSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

* `report d/DD/MM/YYYY` +

The above command shows a report on specified date. +

* `report d/MM/YYYY` +

The above command shows a report on specified month. +

* `report d/YYYY` +

The above command shows a report on specified year. +

* `report` +

The above command shows a completed report from first day of user launches the ePiggy. +

Commands with different format of tag `d/` will generate a report with different charts. +

Eg: `report d/21/03/2019` +

The above report command will generate a report of 21 Mar 2019 with AreaChart.

[NOTE]
Only last tag `d/` is used to generate a report if multiply of `d/` appear.

===== Current Implementation

This section shows the current implementation of the report feature. It also shows the classes or components used in the report feature.

The command is first parsed into link:https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S2-W17-4/main/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/epiggy/ReportCommandParser.java[`ReportCommandParser`],
which separates the arguments into their respective fields. A new link:https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/time/LocalDate.html[`localDate`]
object is created and link:[`type`] of the report are generated according to the date format of `d/`.
The link:https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S2-W17-4/main/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`model`],
link:https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/time/LocalDate.html[`localDate`] and link:[`type`] are parsed into
link:https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S2-W17-4/main/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/epiggy/ReportCommand.java[`ReportCommand`]. +

The link:https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S2-W17-4/main/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/epiggy/ReportCommand.java[`reportCommand`] will initialize link:https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S2-W17-4/main/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/ReportWindow.java[`ReportWindow`] and the method
link:https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S2-W17-4/main/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/ReportWindow.java[`displayReportController`] of the object
link:https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S2-W17-4/main/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/ReportWindow.java[`ReportWindow`] will be invoked. +

The link:https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S2-W17-4/main/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/ReportWindow.java[`displayReportController`] method will select a specified type of report to display the report.

*Example usage scenario:* +
1. User launches application and enters `Report d/21/03/2019`. +
2. link:https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S2-W17-4/main/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/epiggy/ReportCommandParser.java[`ReportCommandParser`] takes in the arguments and parses the command to create the appropriate
link:https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/time/LocalDate.html[`localDate`]. +
3. The link:https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S2-W17-4/main/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/ReportWindow.java[`ReportWindow`] is passed back to the
link:https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S2-W17-4/main/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/LogicManager.java[`LogicManager`], and the method
link:https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S2-W17-4/main/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/LogicManager.java[`execute()`] is called. The
link:https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S2-W17-4/main/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/ReportWindow.java[`ReportWindow`] is initialized. +
4. The method link:https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S2-W17-4/main/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/ReportWindow.java[`displayReportController`] is called and report will show.

===== Design Considerations

This section shows the design considerations of the report feature. The design considerations are shown below together
with their pros and cons.

*Aspect: How should we make the report more readable?* +

* *Alternative 1 (current choice)*: the `report` command uses a chart to display different data of expenses, budgets and allowances.
** Pros: Easy to know how much a user have spend on that date, that month or that year. Easy to compare with previous month or year.
** Cons: The details of the expenses, budgets and allowances cannot show in the chart.

* *Alternative 2* : Show the records of expenses, budgets and allowances in details line by line.
** Pros: User can know the details of each records.
** Cons: Report feature becomes extra because list command can do the same thing.
// end::report[]

=== Miscellaneous
// tag::autocomplete[]
==== Auto-complete feature

*_ePiggy_* allows users to reduce the time spent typing and time spent learning ePiggy's commands, especially because ePiggy
uses the Command Line Interface. The auto-complete feature allows ePiggy to be more user-friendly. +

Given below is an activity diagram of how the link:https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S2-W17-4/main/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/CommandBox.java[`auto-complete`]
feature works: +

.Auto-Complete Activity Diagram
image::AutocompleteActivityDiagram.png[width="800"]

This feature first requires users to enter the first few letters of their intended command on the
link:https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S2-W17-4/main/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/CommandBox.java[`commandBox`]
of ePiggy. Afterwards, users can simply press the *Tab* key to automatically complete their command.
If the completed command is not the user's intended command, they can delete the command before entering the same letters and pressing *Tab* again.
Another command will show if the letters match it. +

For example, the user can enter letter 'a', press *Tab* and "addExpense n/ $/ t/ d/ " will show. The user can then
delete the command, enter 'a' again and press *Tab*. The `addBudget` or `addAllowance` command will show.

[NOTE]
The auto-complete feature compares the last part of the sub-string from the user input to the prefix of command in the
checklist. It is non-case sensitive.

For example, the user can type " `hello add` " to the commandBox, so the sub-string is "add". "add" is used to compare
with commands in the checklist such as "setBudget", "addExpense", "addAllowance". The two commands "addExpense" and
"addAllowance" will be returned but only one of them will replace "add" in the commandBox.
The commandBox will show either " `hello addExpense n/ $/ t/ d/` " or " `hello addAllowance n/ $/ d/` ".

===== Current Implementation

This section shows the current implementation of the auto-complete feature. It also shows the classes or components used in the auto-complete feature.

The auto-complete function's code is in the link:https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S2-W17-4/main/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/CommandBox.java[`CommandBox`] class.
The link:https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S2-W17-4/main/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/CommandBox.java[`autoCompleteText()`] method is invoked when user presses *Tab*. The sub-string (last part split by white space) of user input text and a checklist of commands pass into
link:https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S2-W17-4/main/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/CommandBox.java[`findString()`].
link:https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S2-W17-4/main/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/CommandBox.java[`findString()`] returns an array of matched commands. One element in the array replaces and shows
in the commandBox.

*Example usage scenario:* +
1. User launches application and enters `addE`. +
2. link:https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S2-W17-4/main/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/CommandBox.java[`autoCompleteText()`] is invoked. +
3. link:https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S2-W17-4/main/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/CommandBox.java[`findString()`] takes in the arguments and returns an array of matched commands. +
4. link:https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S2-W17-4/main/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/CommandBox.java[`findString()`] forms a new string using the user's input.
One element in the return array is appended at the end of the new string. This new string replaces the user's input of `addE` and shows in the commandBox.

===== Design Considerations

This section shows the design considerations of the auto-complete feature. The design considerations are shown below together
with their pros and cons.

*Aspect: How should we implement such a function in the UI?* +

* *Alternative 1 (current choice)*: The matched command shows after users press *Tab*.
** Pros: Easy to implement. No third party library is used, which means that all behaviours of this feature is under
control and no extra learning cost is needed.
** Cons: The auto-complete command matched may not be what the user wants. Users will then need to delete the command
and invoke the function again.

* *Alternative 2*: A dropdown list of matched commands shows as the user is typing.
** Pros: User can see all the matched commands and select one of them.
** Cons: A third party library is needed. However, there is no such library under the MIT licence and hence we are unable
to do this.
// end::autocomplete[]

// tag::undoredo[]
==== Undo/Redo feature

===== Current Implementation

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedEPiggy`.
It extends `ePiggy` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `ePiggyStateList` and `currentStatePointer`.
Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedEPiggy#commit()` -- Saves the current ePiggy state in its history.
* `VersionedEPiggy#undo()` -- Restores the previous ePiggy state from its history.
* `VersionedEPiggy#redo()` -- Restores a previously undone ePiggy state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitEPiggy()`, `Model#undoEPiggy()` and `Model#redoEPiggy()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedEPiggy` will be initialized with the initial ePiggy state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single ePiggy state.

image::UndoRedoStartingStateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 2. The user executes `de 5` command to delete the 5th expense in the ePiggy. The `de` command calls `Model#commitEPiggy()`, causing the modified state of the ePiggy after the `de 5` command executes to be saved in the `ePiggyStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted ePiggy state.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand1StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 3. The user executes `ae n/chick ...` to add a new expense. The `ae` command also calls `Model#commitEPiggy()`, causing another modified ePiggy state to be saved into the `ePiggyStateList`.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand2StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitEPiggy()`, so the ePiggy state will not be saved into the `ePiggyStateList`.

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the expense was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoEPiggy()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous ePiggy state, and restores the ePiggy to that state.

image::UndoRedoExecuteUndoStateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial ePiggy state, then there are no previous ePiggy states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoEPiggy()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the undo.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

image::UndoRedoSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

The `redo` command does the opposite -- it calls `Model#redoEPiggy()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the ePiggy to that state.

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `ePiggyStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest ePiggy state, then there are no undone ePiggy states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoEPiggy()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the ePiggy, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitEPiggy()`, `Model#undoEPiggy()` or `Model#redoEPiggy()`. Thus, the `ePiggyStateList` remains unchanged.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand3StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitEPiggy()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `ePiggyStateList`, all ePiggy states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. We designed it this way because it no longer makes sense to redo the `ae n/chick ...` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand4StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

image::UndoRedoActivityDiagram.png[width="800"]

===== Design Considerations

*Aspect: How undo & redo executes*

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire ePiggy.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.
* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself.
** Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `deleteExpense`, just save the expense being deleted).
** Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

*Aspect: Data structure to support the undo/redo commands*

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a list to store the history of ePiggy states.
** Pros: Easy for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be the new incoming developers of our project.
** Cons: Logic is duplicated twice. For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update both `HistoryManager` and `VersionedEPiggy`.
* **Alternative 2:** Use `HistoryManager` for undo/redo
** Pros: We do not need to maintain a separate list, and just reuse what is already in the codebase.
** Cons: Requires dealing with commands that have already been undone: We must remember to skip these commands. Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two different things.
// end::undoredo[]

==== Logging

We are using the `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
==== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g user prefs file location, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

== Documentation

image::developerguidedocumentation.png[width="350"]
We use asciidoc for writing documentation.

[NOTE]
We chose asciidoc over Markdown because asciidoc, although a bit more complex than Markdown, provides more flexibility in formatting.

=== Editing Documentation

See <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to render `.adoc` files locally to preview the end result of your edits.
Alternatively, you can download the AsciiDoc plugin for IntelliJ, which allows you to preview the changes you have made to your `.adoc` files in real-time.

=== Publishing Documentation

See <<UsingTravis#deploying-github-pages, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to deploy GitHub Pages using Travis.

=== Converting Documentation to PDF format

We use https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/[Google Chrome] for converting documentation to PDF format, as Chrome's PDF engine preserves hyperlinks used in webpages.

Here are the steps to convert the project documentation files to PDF format.

.  Follow the instructions in <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to convert the AsciiDoc files in the `docs/` directory to HTML format.
.  Go to your generated HTML files in the `build/docs` folder, right click on them and select `Open with` -> `Google Chrome`.
.  Within Chrome, click on the `Print` option in Chrome's menu.
.  Set the destination to `Save as PDF`, then click `Save` to save a copy of the file in PDF format. For best results, use the settings indicated in the screenshot below.

=== Site Template

The files in link:{repoURL}/docs/stylesheets[`docs/stylesheets`] are the https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS[CSS stylesheets] of the site.
You can modify them to change some properties of the site's design.

The files in link:{repoURL}/docs/templates[`docs/templates`] controls the rendering of `.adoc` files into HTML5.
These template files are written in a mixture of https://www.ruby-lang.org[Ruby] and http://slim-lang.com[Slim].

[WARNING]
====
Modifying the template files in link:{repoURL}/docs/templates[`docs/templates`] requires some knowledge and experience with Ruby and Asciidoctor's API.
You should only modify them if you need greater control over the site's layout than what stylesheets can provide.
The SE-EDU team does not provide support for modified template files.

=== Running Tests

There are three ways to run tests.

[TIP]
The most reliable way to run tests is the 3rd one. The first two methods might fail some GUI tests due to platform/resolution-specific idiosyncrasies.

*Method 1: Using IntelliJ JUnit test runner*

* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose `Run 'All Tests'`
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose `Run 'ABC'`

*Method 2: Using Gradle*

* Open a console and run the command `gradlew clean allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean allTests`)

[NOTE]
See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> for more info on how to run tests using Gradle.

*Method 3: Using Gradle (headless)*

Thanks to the https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX[TestFX] library we use, our GUI tests can be run in the _headless_ mode. In the headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen. That means the developer can do other things on the Computer while the tests are running.

To run tests in headless mode, open a console and run the command `gradlew clean headless allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean headless allTests`)

=== Types of tests

We have two types of tests:

.  *GUI Tests* - These are tests involving the GUI. They include,
.. _System Tests_ that test the entire App by simulating user actions on the GUI. These are in the `systemtests` package.
.. _Unit tests_ that test the individual components. These are in `seedu.address.ui` package.
.  *Non-GUI Tests* - These are tests not involving the GUI. They include,
..  _Unit tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes. +
e.g. `seedu.address.commons.StringUtilTest`
..  _Integration tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code units (those code units are assumed to be working). +
e.g. `seedu.address.storage.StorageManagerTest`
..  Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These test are checking multiple code units as well as how the are connected together. +
e.g. `seedu.address.logic.LogicManagerTest`


=== Troubleshooting Testing
**Problem: `HelpWindowTest` fails with a `NullPointerException`.**

== Development and Operations

image::developerguidedevops.png[width="350"]

=== Build Automation

See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

=== Continuous Integration

We use https://travis-ci.org/[Travis CI] and https://www.appveyor.com/[AppVeyor] to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our projects. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> and <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>> for more details.

=== Coverage Reporting

We use https://coveralls.io/[Coveralls] to track the code coverage of our projects. See <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>> for more details.

=== Documentation Previews
When a pull request has changes to asciidoc files, you can use https://www.netlify.com/[Netlify] to see a preview of how the HTML version of those asciidoc files will look like when the pull request is merged. See <<UsingNetlify#, UsingNetlify.adoc>> for more details.

=== Making a Release

Here are the steps to create a new release.

.  Update the version number in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp.java`].
.  Generate a JAR file <<UsingGradle#creating-the-jar-file, using Gradle>>.
.  Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
.  https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/[Create a new release using GitHub] and upload the JAR file you created.

=== Managing Dependencies

A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, ePiggy depends on the https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson[Jackson library] for JSON parsing. Managing these _dependencies_ can be automated using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which is better than these alternatives:

[loweralpha]
. Include those libraries in the repo (this bloats the repo size)
. Require developers to download those libraries manually (this creates extra work for developers)

[[GetStartedProgramming]]
[appendix]
== Suggested Programming Tasks to Get Started

Suggested path for new programmers:

1. First, add small local-impact (i.e. the impact of the change does not go beyond the component) enhancements to one component at a time. Some suggestions are given in <<GetStartedProgramming-EachComponent>>.

2. Next, add a feature that touches multiple components to learn how to implement an end-to-end feature across all components. <<GetStartedProgramming-RemarkCommand>> explains how to go about adding such a feature.

[[GetStartedProgramming-EachComponent]]
=== Improving each component

Each individual exercise in this section is component-based (i.e. you would not need to modify the other components to get it to work).

[discrete]
==== `Logic` component

*Scenario:* You are in charge of `logic`. During dog-fooding, your team realize that it is troublesome for the user to type the whole command in order to execute a command. Your team devise some strategies to help cut down the amount of typing necessary, and one of the suggestions was to implement aliases for the command words. Your job is to implement such aliases.

[TIP]
Do take a look at <<Design-Logic>> before attempting to modify the `Logic` component.

. Add a shorthand equivalent alias for each of the individual commands. For example, besides typing `clear`, the user can also type `c` to remove all expenses in the list.
+
****
* Hints
** Just like we store each individual command word constant `COMMAND_WORD` inside `*Command.java` (e.g.  link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/FindCommand.java[`FindCommand#COMMAND_WORD`], link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/DeleteCommand.java[`DeleteCommand#COMMAND_WORD`]), you need a new constant for aliases as well (e.g. `FindCommand#COMMAND_ALIAS`).
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/EPiggyParser.java[`EPiggyParser`] is responsible for analyzing command words.
* Solution
** Modify the switch statement in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/EPiggyParser.java[`EPiggyParser#parseCommand(String)`] such that both the proper command word and alias can be used to execute the same intended command.
** Add new tests for each of the aliases that you have added.
** Update the user guide to document the new aliases.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/785[PR] for the full solution.
****

[discrete]
==== `Model` component

*Scenario:* You are in charge of `model`. One day, the `logic`-in-charge approaches you for help. He wants to implement a command such that the user is able to remove a particular tag from everyone in ePiggy, but the model API does not support such a functionality at the moment. Your job is to implement an API method, so that your teammate can use your API to implement his command.

[TIP]
Do take a look at <<Design-Model>> before attempting to modify the `Model` component.

. Add a `removeTag(Tag)` method. The specified tag will be removed from everyone in the ePiggy.
+
****
* Hints
** The link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model`] and the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/ePiggy.java[`ePiggy`] API need to be updated.
** Think about how you can use SLAP to design the method. Where should we place the main logic of deleting tags?
**  Find out which of the existing API methods in  link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/ePiggy.java[`ePiggy`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/expense/Expense.java[`Expense`] classes can be used to implement the tag removal logic. link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/ePiggy.java[`ePiggy`] allows you to update a expense, and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/expense/Expense.java[`Expense`] allows you to update the tags.
* Solution
** Implement a `removeTag(Tag)` method in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/ePiggy.java[`ePiggy`]. Loop through each expense, and remove the `tag` from each expense.
** Add a new API method `deleteTag(Tag)` in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/ModelManager.java[`ModelManager`]. Your link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/ModelManager.java[`ModelManager`] should call `ePiggy#removeTag(Tag)`.
** Add new tests for each of the new public methods that you have added.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/790[PR] for the full solution.

[discrete]
==== `Ui` component

*Scenario:* You are in charge of `ui`. During a beta testing session, your team is observing how users use your ePiggy application. You realize that one of users occasionally tries to delete non-existent tags from a contact, because the tags all look the same visually, and the user got confused. Another user made a typing mistake in his command, but did not realize he had done so because the error message wasn't prominent enough. A third user keeps scrolling down the list, because he keeps forgetting the index of the last expense in the list. Your job is to implement improvements to the UI to solve all these problems.

[TIP]
Do take a look at <<Design-Ui>> before attempting to modify the `UI` component.

. Use different colors for different tags inside expense cards. For example, `friends` tags can be all in brown, and `colleagues` tags can be all in yellow.

**After**

image::getting-started-ui-tag-after.png[width="300"]

****
* Hints
** The tag labels are created inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[the `PersonCard` constructor] (`new Label(tag.tagName)`). https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/javafx/api/javafx/scene/control/Label.html[JavaFX's `Label` class] allows you to modify the style of each Label, such as changing its color.
** Use the .css attribute `-fx-background-color` to add a color.
** You may wish to modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/DarkTheme.css[`DarkTheme.css`] to include some pre-defined colors using css, especially if you have experience with web-based css.
* Solution
** You can modify the existing test methods for `PersonCard` 's to include testing the tag's color as well.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/798[PR] for the full solution.
*** The PR uses the hash code of the tag names to generate a color. This is deliberately designed to ensure consistent colors each time the application runs. You may wish to expand on this design to include additional features, such as allowing users to set their own tag colors, and directly saving the colors to storage, so that tags retain their colors even if the hash code algorithm changes.

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/commons/events/ui/NewResultAvailableEvent.java[`NewResultAvailableEvent`] such that link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/ResultDisplay.java[`ResultDisplay`] can show a different style on error (currently it shows the same regardless of errors).

* Hints
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/commons/events/ui/NewResultAvailableEvent.java[`NewResultAvailableEvent`] is raised by link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/CommandBox.java[`CommandBox`] which also knows whether the result is a success or failure, and is caught by link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/ResultDisplay.java[`ResultDisplay`] which is where we want to change the style to.
** Refer to link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/CommandBox.java[`CommandBox`] for an example on how to display an error.
* Solution
** Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/commons/events/ui/NewResultAvailableEvent.java[`NewResultAvailableEvent`] 's constructor so that users of the event can indicate whether an error has occurred.
** Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/ResultDisplay.java[`ResultDisplay#handleNewResultAvailableEvent(NewResultAvailableEvent)`] to react to this event appropriately.
** You can write two different kinds of tests to ensure that the functionality works:
*** The unit tests for `ResultDisplay` can be modified to include verification of the color.
*** The system tests link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/systemtests/EPiggySystemTest.java[`EPiggySystemTest#assertCommandBoxShowsDefaultStyle() and EPiggySystemTest#assertCommandBoxShowsErrorStyle()`] to include verification for `ResultDisplay` as well.

+
image::getting-started-ui-status-after.png[width="500"]

****
* Hints
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/StatusBarFooter.fxml[`StatusBarFooter.fxml`] will need a new `StatusBar`. Be sure to set the `GridPane.columnIndex` properly for each `StatusBar` to avoid misalignment!
** link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/StatusBarFooter.java[`StatusBarFooter`] needs to initialize the status bar on application start, and to update it accordingly whenever the ePiggy is updated.
* Solution
** Modify the constructor of link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/StatusBarFooter.java[`StatusBarFooter`] to take in the number of expenses when the application just started.
** Use link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/StatusBarFooter.java[`StatusBarFooter#handleEPiggyChangedEvent(EPiggyChangedEvent)`] to update the number of expenses whenever there are new changes to the addressbook.
** For tests, modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/guitests/guihandles/StatusBarFooterHandle.java[`StatusBarFooterHandle`] by adding a state-saving functionality for the total number of people status, just like what we did for save location and sync status.
** For system tests, modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/systemtests/EPiggySystemTest.java[`EPiggySystemTest`] to also verify the new total number of expenses status bar.
** See this https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/pull/803[PR] for the full solution.

[discrete]
==== `Storage` component

*Scenario:* You are in charge of `storage`. For your next project milestone, your team plans to implement a new feature of saving the ePiggy to the cloud. However, the current implementation of the application constantly saves the ePiggy after the execution of each command, which is not ideal if the user is working on limited internet connection. Your team decided that the application should instead save the changes to a temporary local backup file first, and only upload to the cloud after the user closes the application. Your job is to implement a backup API for the ePiggy storage.

[TIP]
Do take a look at <<Design-Storage>> before attempting to modify the `Storage` component.

. Add a new method `backupEPiggy(ReadOnlyEPiggy)`, so that the ePiggy can be saved in a fixed temporary location.
+
****
* Hint
** Add the API method in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/EPiggyStorage.java[`EPiggyStorage`] interface.
** Implement the logic in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/StorageManager.java[`StorageManager`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/JsonEPiggyStorage.java[`JsonEPiggyStorage`] class.

[[GetStartedProgramming-RemarkCommand]]
=== Creating a new command: `remark`

By creating this command, you will get a chance to learn how to implement a feature end-to-end, touching all major components of the app.

*Scenario:* You are a software maintainer for `addressbook`, as the former developer team has moved on to new projects. The current users of your application have a list of new feature requests that they hope the software will eventually have. The most popular request is to allow adding additional comments/notes about a particular contact, by providing a flexible `remark` field for each contact, rather than relying on tags alone. After designing the specification for the `remark` command, you are convinced that this feature is worth implementing. Your job is to implement the `remark` command.

==== Description
Edits the remark for a expense specified in the `INDEX`. +
Format: `remark INDEX r/[REMARK]`

Examples:

* `remark 1 r/Likes to drink coffee.` +
Edits the remark for the first expense to `Likes to drink coffee.`
* `remark 1 r/` +
Removes the remark for the first expense.

==== Step-by-step Instructions

===== [Step 1] Logic: Teach the app to accept 'remark' which does nothing
Let's start by teaching the application how to parse a `remark` command. We will add the logic of `remark` later.

**Main:**

. Add a `RemarkCommand` that extends link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/commands/Command.java[`Command`]. Upon execution, it should just throw an `Exception`.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/EPiggyParser.java[`EPiggyParser`] to accept a `RemarkCommand`.

**Tests:**

. Add `RemarkCommandTest` that tests that `execute()` throws an Exception.
. Add new test method to link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/EPiggyParserTest.java[`EPiggyParserTest`], which tests that typing "remark" returns an instance of `RemarkCommand`.

===== [Step 2] Logic: Teach the app to accept 'remark' arguments
Let's teach the application to parse arguments that our `remark` command will accept. E.g. `1 r/Likes to drink coffee.`

**Main:**

. Modify `RemarkCommand` to take in an `Index` and `String` and print those two parameters as the error message.
. Add `RemarkCommandParser` that knows how to parse two arguments, one index and one with prefix 'r/'.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/EPiggyParser.java[`EPiggyParser`] to use the newly implemented `RemarkCommandParser`.

**Tests:**

. Modify `RemarkCommandTest` to test the `RemarkCommand#equals()` method.
. Add `RemarkCommandParserTest` that tests different boundary values
for `RemarkCommandParser`.
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/EPiggyParserTest.java[`EPiggyParserTest`] to test that the correct command is generated according to the user input.

===== [Step 3] Ui: Add a placeholder for remark in `PersonCard`
Let's add a placeholder on all our link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`] s to display a remark for each expense later.

**Main:**

. Add a `Label` with any random text inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/PersonListCard.fxml[`PersonListCard.fxml`].
. Add FXML annotation in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`] to tie the variable to the actual label.

**Tests:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/guitests/guihandles/PersonCardHandle.java[`PersonCardHandle`] so that future tests can read the contents of the remark label.

===== [Step 4] Model: Add `Remark` class
We have to properly encapsulate the remark in our link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/expense/Expense.java[`Expense`] class. Instead of just using a `String`, let's follow the conventional class structure that the codebase already uses by adding a `Remark` class.

**Main:**

. Add `Remark` to model component (you can copy from link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/expense/Address.java[`Address`], remove the regex and change the names accordingly).
. Modify `RemarkCommand` to now take in a `Remark` instead of a `String`.

**Tests:**

. Add test for `Remark`, to test the `Remark#equals()` method.

===== [Step 5] Model: Modify `Expense` to support a `Remark` field
Now we have the `Remark` class, we need to actually use it inside link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/expense/Expense.java[`Expense`].

**Main:**

. Add `getRemark()` in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/expense/Expense.java[`Expense`].
. You may assume that the user will not be able to use the `add` and `edit` commands to modify the remarks field (i.e. the expense will be created without a remark).
. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/util/SampleDataUtil.java/[`SampleDataUtil`] to add remarks for the sample data (delete your `data/addressbook.json` so that the application will load the sample data when you launch it.)

===== [Step 6] Storage: Add `Remark` field to `JsonAdaptedPerson` class
We now have `Remark` s for `Expense` s, but they will be gone when we exit the application. Let's modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/JsonAdaptedPerson.java[`JsonAdaptedPerson`] to include a `Remark` field so that it will be saved.

**Main:**

. Add a new JSON field for `Remark`.

**Tests:**

. Fix `invalidAndValidPersonEPiggy.json`, `typicalPersonsEPiggy.json`, `validEPiggy.json` etc., such that the JSON tests will not fail due to a missing `remark` field.

===== [Step 6b] Test: Add withRemark() for `PersonBuilder`
Since `Expense` can now have a `Remark`, we should add a helper method to link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/testutil/PersonBuilder.java[`PersonBuilder`], so that users are able to create remarks when building a link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/expense/Expense.java[`Expense`].

**Tests:**

. Add a new method `withRemark()` for link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/testutil/PersonBuilder.java[`PersonBuilder`]. This method will create a new `Remark` for the expense that it is currently building.
. Try and use the method on any sample `Expense` in link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/testutil/TypicalPersons.java[`TypicalPersons`].

===== [Step 7] Ui: Connect `Remark` field to `PersonCard`
Our remark label in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`] is still a placeholder. Let's bring it to life by binding it with the actual `remark` field.

**Main:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/PersonCard.java[`PersonCard`]'s constructor to bind the `Remark` field to the `Expense` 's remark.

**Tests:**

. Modify link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/ui/testutil/GuiTestAssert.java[`GuiTestAssert#assertCardDisplaysPerson(...)`] so that it will compare the now-functioning remark label.

===== [Step 8] Logic: Implement `RemarkCommand#execute()` logic
We now have everything set up... but we still can't modify the remarks. Let's finish it up by adding in actual logic for our `remark` command.

**Main:**

. Replace the logic in `RemarkCommand#execute()` (that currently just throws an `Exception`), with the actual logic to modify the remarks of a expense.

**Tests:**

. Update `RemarkCommandTest` to test that the `execute()` logic works.
